# Loup-Garou (Werewolf)

A multiplayer Werewolf party game built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, featuring real-time polling, role-based night actions, a day vote phase, and an in-game chat.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.3.2
- **Templating:** Thymeleaf
- **Database:** H2 
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
- **Auth:** Session-based + BCrypt password hashing
- **Build:** Maven

## Features

- User registration and login
- Create a room (as admin) or join one with a room code
- Minimum 5 players required to start
- Automatic role assignment: Villager, Wolf, Seer, Witch
- Timed game phases with configurable durations
- Night phase: Wolves vote to eliminate, Seer investigates, Witch uses potions
- Day phase: Group chat, then vote to eliminate a suspect
- Win condition detection: Village wins when all wolves are eliminated; Wolves win when they equal or outnumber the villagers
- Per-player event visibility (private role reveals, public announcements)
- H2 console for database inspection during development

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher (Java 21 is fine)
- Maven (or IntelliJ IDEA with Maven support)

## Game Flow

1. **Register / Log in**
2. **Lobby** — Create a room (you become admin) or join one using a room code
3. **Start** — Admin starts the game once at least 5 players have joined
4. **Night phases** (timed):
   - Wolves vote on a target
   - Seer investigates one player's role
   - Witch uses save or poison potion
5. **Day phases** (timed):
   - All players discuss in chat
   - Players vote to eliminate a suspect
6. **Win condition** — game ends when:
   - All wolves are eliminated → **Village wins**
   - Wolves equal or outnumber remaining villagers → **Wolves win**

## Roles
